## Build
- Run `make` to build the program.

- Run `make DEBUG=true` to build the program with debug flag (prints every step)

- Run `make clean` to remove the built program.


## Usage
- Run `./main.exe` and enter the parameters interactively.

- Run `Get-Content test.txt | .\main.exe` where `test.txt` is the file path where parameters are specified. (Similar to `./main < test.txt` in Linux)
